## About

---

:::: side-by-side

:::

I'm a software developer from Belfast, currently living in the US of A :statue_of_liberty:â€‹.

This website serves as a portfolio of my projects, and a place to post content I find interesting or useful.
It was generated using a custom [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator),
is currently hosted on GitHub pages, and built via GitHub actions.

I can be reached via email at `contact [at] wasteofcyberspace [dot] net` or on GitHub at <https://github.com/ZX-80>.

## Site Info

---

My first website was written in 2017 with raw HTML/CSS and has unfortunately been abandoned for many years (writing each page like that is 
no fun). This project started around 2023, as a spin-off from a [djot](https://djot.net/) parser I was writing for [Python](https://www.python.org/). I figured 
if I could turn simple documents like djot into HTML I might as well fix up my old website.

### Features

  - Easily extensible via filters

    - [Mermaid JS](https://mermaid.js.org/) charts
    - GitHub style [alerts](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925)
    - Syntax highlighting (580+ languages)
    - Tabs
    - Table of contents (TOC)
  - [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) support
  - Uses git to manage created / edited dates
  - Page metadata
  - Automatic anchors for page elements
  - Generated navigation bar with TOC
  - Supports 60+ document types as input
  
To speed up development, I've made use of some other libraries:

- [Pygments](https://pygments.org/): Syntax highlighting for nearly 580+ languages.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): Document to HTML conversion
- [Panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute): Easy editing of pandoc documents
- [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate/tree/master): HTML templating in Python

### Building

Building is as simple as `git push`, after which a GitHub action will install and run the build script at <https://github.com/ZX-80/Cyberspace>,
publishing to GitHub pages.

The build script itself will scan for css files, top-level source files (for the navigation bar), and filters. Then it will run each 
source file in the source directory through the following stages:

1. Convert the document to a panflute document
2. Apply filters one by one
3. Convert the panflute document into the article HTML
4. Wrap the article HTML to get the page HTML

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    %% Convert to panflute document
    Document -- pandoc --> panflute_doc[Panflute Document]
    %% Apply filters
    panflute_doc --> Filters --> panflute_doc
    %% Convert to article HTML
    panflute_doc -- pandoc --> article_html[Article HTML] 
    %% Wrap article HTML in page HTML
    article_html --> full_html[Full HTML]
```
